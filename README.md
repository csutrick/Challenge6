# Challenge 6

## Description

This website was created to help you find out what the weather is for the day and coming 5 days. This project was fun to work on but I ahd some trouble getting the date to work. I waited to the end to mess around with the date and I couldnt really figure it out, so i left it broken but submitted it anyways as everything else is working. Overall if I had to redo the assignment again I woudl make sure the date works.

## Installation

just navigate to the URl and type in city name to see the weather like temp, wind speed and humidity

## Usage

Just enter a city and see your info be displayed on the page. If the city is misspelled or not found it will alert the user. You can navigate away and come back and your past searches will still be rendered to the page. You can even click a pastsearch and it will display the current info.
